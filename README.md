String Smash
===========

Utilising the [Xposed framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer), this module lets you change almost every string on your phone to whatever you want.

This was inspired by the [Hodor Module](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.germainz.hodor) ([Github](https://github.com/GermainZ/Hodor/)) and just adds a UI and a ability to turn it on/off on the fly

Just set a text you want and enable the switch. Just switch off to end it. You may have to reboot to set everything to normal again.
Remeber that this is just a fun app, be careful on a productive phone!
